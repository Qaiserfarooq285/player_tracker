    produces a DIFFERENT hash and therefore a cache MISS on every stage for a video that had

    treehouse", 2026-09-14) -- the honest replacement for the old frontend exporter that re-typed
    an approximation of the statcard client-side (see `exportStatCard`'s own history / the plan's
    Context section: it flattened "not available (...)" to a bare `0`, a Golden Rule 5 violation).

    Resolved via `_find_output_dir` (exact slug match, the same helper `/api/results/{slug}`
    already uses) then `_safe_resolve_under`, rooted at `OUTPUT_DIR` -- deliberately NOT `BASE_DIR`
    (that root is what the `/media/` fix below closes) -- since this endpoint only ever needs to
    serve a file already known to live under `output/`. `jersey` is taken as an opaque path
    segment straight from the URL and never joined onto the filesystem directly; it is resolved
    strictly as one more path component under `OUTPUT_DIR` through the same traversal guard, so a
    `../../etc/passwd`-shaped value 404s exactly like any other escape attempt, never a 500.

    Plan Fix D ("streamed-gathering-treehouse" re-check, 2026-09-15): when `statcard.pdf` is
    missing but `statcard.md` exists, the PDF is now generated ON DEMAND
    (`_generate_statcard_pdf_on_demand`) and cached to disk, so every completed run becomes
    downloadable -- not just runs from after Plan Stage 3 shipped the PDF feature.

    404s (never 500s) for a missing slug, a missing player folder, or a statcard.md that genuinely
    doesn't exist either (nothing to generate from) -- an honest "not found", never a confusing
    server error for something that is really just "this run doesn't have a PDF (yet)".

    Plan Stage 3 ("streamed-gathering-treehouse", 2026-09-14) security fix: this used to probe
    `_safe_resolve_under(BASE_DIR, path)` FIRST. The traversal guard itself was sound, but its
    containment root was the WHOLE REPO -- so `GET /media/.env` served the secrets file, and
    `configs/`, `src/`, `models/` were all readable over HTTP. Every real `/media/` URL this
    project actually generates (confirmed by grepping every reference in `apps/web/` and this
    file) is one of exactly two shapes: a bare INPUT_DIR-relative video name/path (e.g.
    `preview.src = /media/${videoName}`, `apps/web/js/app.js::updatePreviewVideo`) or an
