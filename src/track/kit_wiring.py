"""Stage 3 of the "streamed-gathering-treehouse" plan (strict persistent target identity, see
`/home/qaiserfarooq/.claude/plans/streamed-gathering-treehouse.md`): wire per-track kit colour into
production for TWO consumers that need two DIFFERENT shapes of the same underlying measurement:

1. `src.events.possession.detect_passes`'s `teammates_test` (via `kit_lab_by_track_id`) needs ONE
   Lab value per track -- a single upper-torso region read (`src.events.kit_colour.kit_lab_sample`,
   the same ADR-21 `number_region` geometry already used for jersey OCR), aggregated across a
   track's own sampled frames via `median_kit_lab`. This is the ADR-20 "grass-suppressed kit colour
   as the primary teammate/opponent signal" measurement -- it was already implemented in
   `src.events.kit_colour` but nothing ever called it: `detect_passes`'s own `kit_lab_by_track_id`
   parameter has been dead code since it was added.
2. `src.track.target_verify.verify_candidate`'s `kit_by_track` needs a per-track `KitColourSample`
   (torso/shorts/socks THREE-band read, `src.track.target.sample_kit_bands`) -- a different crop
   geometry, built for a different purpose (hard-reject a candidate whose kit colour contradicts
   the persistent target's own profile, not "are these two CURRENTLY-tracked players teammates").

**Judgement call (plan Stage 3 explicitly asks for one):** `sample_kit_bands`'s 3-band read is NOT
a substitute for `kit_lab_sample`'s single upper-torso region for consumer (1) -- `detect_passes`
only ever needs one Lab value to compare against another player's, and collapsing 3 bands into 1
would either throw away 2/3 of a band-confidence-weighted read for no reason, or require inventing
a new aggregation rule nobody asked for. Conversely `sample_kit_bands` cannot be replaced by
`kit_lab_sample` for consumer (2) -- `verify_candidate`'s hard-reject step is torso-dominant but
explicitly falls back to shorts/socks when torso itself has no evidence (`_combined_kit_verdict`'s
own docstring), which needs all three bands. So this module computes BOTH aggregates from the SAME
decoded frames rather than picking one: "build it once, use it for both purposes" (the plan's own
words) is satisfied at the DECODE level (one `decode_frames` pass per take, the genuinely expensive
part) even though the two PER-FRAME crop-and-aggregate steps stay separate arithmetic -- reusing an
already-decoded frame for a second, cheap in-memory crop costs nothing next to a second full decode.

    floor -- an honest "no colour evidence", never a guess (both callers already treat a missing
    entry as "no evidence either way", never a rejection).
